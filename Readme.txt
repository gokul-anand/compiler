Go through the base code.

Write ur lex and yacc file accordingly.

name lex file as lex.l and yacc file as grammer.y

execute the compile.sh file as 
		sh compile.sh

exe file will be generated

run it as 
	./exe < input.txt
( input.txt file should contain the program- )


The above setup works fine with ubuntu.
If the compile.sh runs without throwing any error , then any program can be written using c and c++
